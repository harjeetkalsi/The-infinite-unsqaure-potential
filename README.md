# The-infinite-unsqaure-potential
This notebook looks at boundary values in sloving differential equations and will first solve for an infinte square potenital well. It will the be possible to extend this to calculate for systems where there is no simple analytical solution.

The task involves applying knowlegde of boundary value problems to the one-dimentional time-independent Schrodinger equation (TISE): 
$$
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2} + V(x)\psi(x) = E\psi(x)
$$

Over the course of this notebook we will look at different functions of potenital and try to solve for solutions. We will look at, the infinite square well potential, a harmonic potenital within an infinte sqaure well, a finite sqaure well potential and then I will try  my own choice of potenital( a rectangular barrier potential.)
